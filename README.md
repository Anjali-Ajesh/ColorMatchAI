# ColorMatchAI
An interactive web application that uses color theory rules and simulated machine learning to help users generate, evaluate, and explore color palettes for UI/UX, branding, or any creative project.
## Features

-   **Color Palette Generator:** Input a base color using a color picker or hex code and instantly generate palettes based on established color harmonies:
    -   Complementary
    -   Analogous
    -   Triadic
    -   Split-Complementary
    -   Monochromatic
-   **Emotion-Based Suggestions:** Type a keyword (e.g., "luxury," "calm," "energetic") to get a curated color palette that matches the mood. (Simulated ML)
-   **Color Naming:** Enter a hex code, and the tool will predict its common name (e.g., #87CEEB â†’ "Sky Blue"). (Simulated ML)
-   **WCAG Accessibility Checker:** Check the contrast ratio between any two colors to ensure your text is readable and your design is accessible.
-   **Live UI Preview:** See your generated palettes applied instantly to a set of mock UI components (buttons, cards, text) to get a real-world feel for your color choices.

## Technology Stack

-   **HTML5:** For the application structure.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For a modern, responsive layout.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all application logic, including color theory calculations, DOM manipulation, and interactive features.
-   **Chroma.js:** A powerful JavaScript library for color conversions and calculations, loaded via CDN.
